## Preferences and Values
1. Deep down, I'm probably more motivated by impact than money, but probably fall victim too often to seeing financial success as a universal measure of achievement, especially in the short-term.
2. I find big cities (travelling/driving and especially flying) kinda stressful. I'm only interested from time to time in fancy food or drink. I'm more at one with the outdoors.
3. I don't really put much value on appearance or dress. I'm always pretty casual (I don't really own a suit, but have a lot of Goretex!).

## Watch-outs
1. I'm on some part of the spectrum (not sure if it's ADHD, Autism or both). One habit I have in conversations is to not look directly at people or sometimes to have a facial expression that looks quite condescending when in reality I'm just thinking quite deeply. If this happens to you, I apologise for any potential confusion. 
2. Related, I also sometimes fidget quite a bit.

## Communication 
1. I'm not a big fan of phone calls, or SMS/Whatsapp for professional stuff. Fine with Linked In, or Slack. Not really into any other social media, if you message me on Github (pull requests etc are fine!) don't expect a particularly timely response. 
2. My spam-to-email ratio is quite high. I prefer Slack/Linked In.

## Day to Day working guide
1. Much of my life evolves around my 4 year old son Jack. I like to spend with him especially 3pm-7pm, but often work again later in the evening. He's sometimes around my garden office, but rarely interrupts what I'm up to unless he has a playdate. Occasionally I go out somewhere with a nice view around where I live (Dartmoor) and work in my campervan.
2. I'm generally up quite early (6am = even weekends), and even if I'm not infront of my computer I have no issue responding to messages on Slack/Whatsapp etc
3. I live in Devon, and London is sadly quite expensive (and time consuming) to get to, so I definitely prefer video/phone calls. I also quite like going out for a run/walk in the middle of the traditional working day (especially when daylight is scarce in winter).
